1. Arguments are basically an object which is passed form the function call where as splat arguments are array of objects which can be passed spearately from the function call.
2. i. [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
   ii. [7, 6, 5, 3, 2]
   iii. -1
   iv. 1
3. symbols are more faster when compared to strings as symbols have a specific object id and are immutable in nature. Strings need to be converted to objects and then hashed where as symbols are directly hashed.
4. .to_sym and and .itern are aliases to each other and naming is the only change in it.
5. ||= will assign only if varable is nul, = will assign what so ever even if variable is nil or varable is assigned already.
6. Block and procs are same code blocks where procs can be reused but the block can be passed to only one function.
7. Procs and lambdas are exactly the same, except 
      1. lambdas expect exact number of parameters and procs do not and procs consider extra params as nil.
      2. Procs return control back to parent once it sees return inside it where as lambda executes everything and then returns the control.
